# Sharifyar
Sharifyar Android App (Parse API)
Because of rejecting my app for some stupid reasons by [bazaar][1], i decided to publish the source code for `Sharifyar`. I used [Parse API][2] to handle the requests. It is based on `node.js` and is so powerful **-I do not know that currently they still support their users or not**. You need to include the jar file for `Parse` in your `lib` directory and also include it in `gradle` file.
`Sharifyar` is an app to enroll in some courses and then having the instructor you've chosen in your home.
